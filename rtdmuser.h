//	File:		RTDMUSER.h
//
// This program along with MPLAB DMCI ( MPLAB 8.10 or higher) create an alternative link 
//between Host PC and target device for debugging applications in real-time. 
//It is required to include the RTDM.C file and RTDM.h into the application project 
//in order to send/receive data through the UART to/from the host PC running under 
//MPLAB (release 8.10 or higher) DMCI environment. 
// NOTE:DMCI included in MPLAB 8.10 or higher is ready and enabled to support data exchange 
//between the host PC and target device. Previous versions of DMCI do not support this feature. 
// NOTE: RTDM is currently supported by PIC24H, dsPIC30F, dsPIC33F and dsPIC33E processors
//
